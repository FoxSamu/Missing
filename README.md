## Missing Bricks

Ever wanted your favourite missing texture as a block? Then this mod is a perfect one for you! It adds bricks with the
theme of the missing block texture. They are available as blocks, slabs, stairs and walls.

These bricks can be further crafted into slabs, stairs and walls just using the usual patterns, or via the stonecutter.
